## What we do

MugManual is the modern alternative to facebook - built in Ruby on Rails 5.2, with hybrid React pages handling a general wall as a single page application. MugManual allows you to post on a general wall, or a specific users wall - including your own! You can delete your own posts, and edit them within the last 10 minutes!
